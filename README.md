> In principle, dependent type theory should provide an ideal foundation for formalizing graded rings, where each grade can be of a different type.
> However, the power of these foundations leaves a plethora of choices for how to proceed with such a formalization.
> This paper explores various different approaches to how formalization could proceed, and then demonstrates precisely how the authors formalized graded algebras in Lean's {\mathlib}.
> Notably, we show how this formalization was used as an API; allowing us to formalize graded structures such as those on tuples, free monoids, tensor algebras, and Clifford algebras.

Many of the files in this repo are virtually copies of the versions now found in mathlib; they have been separated out for convenience of presentation.
Such files are indicated by a comment of the form `From: https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib/blob/...` in the first few lines.
Other files are extract from in-progress pull requests. These are indicated with a similar comment.
The purpose of this extraction is to aid with understanding the scope of the paper, and to make it easier to nagivate relevant code without having to search the entirety of mathlib.
