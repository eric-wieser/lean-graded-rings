# Decompositions of additive monoids, groups, and modules into direct sums

## Main definitions

* `direct_sum.decomposition ℳ`: A typeclass to provide a constructive decomposition from
  an additive monoid `M` into a family of additive submonoids `ℳ`
* `direct_sum.decompose ℳ`: The canonical equivalence provided by the above typeclass


## Main statements

* `direct_sum.decomposition.is_internal`: The link to `direct_sum.is_internal`.

## Implementation details

As we want to talk about different types of decomposition (additive monoids, modules, rings, ...),
we choose to avoid heavily bundling `direct_sum.decompose`, instead making copies for the
`add_equiv`, `linear_equiv`, etc. This means we have to repeat statements that follow from these
bundled homs, but means we don't have to repeat statements for different types of decomposition.

/-- A decomposition is an equivalence between an additive monoid `M` and a direct sum of additive
submonoids `ℳ i` of that `M`, such that the "recomposition" is canonical. This definition also
works for additive groups and modules.

This is a version of `direct_sum.is_internal` which comes with a constructive inverse to the
canonical "recomposition" rather than just a proof that the "recomposition" is bijective. -/

/-- The `-` in the statements below doesn't resolve without this line.

This seems to a be a problem of synthesized vs inferred typeclasses disagreeing. If we replace
the statement of `decompose_neg` with `@eq (⨁ i, ℳ i) (decompose ℳ (-x)) (-decompose ℳ x)`
instead of `decompose ℳ (-x) = -decompose ℳ x`, which forces the typeclasses needed by `⨁ i, ℳ i` to
be found by unification rather than synthesis, then everything works fine without this instance. -/
